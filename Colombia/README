The Makfile will create a grid file and a weighted clipping mask suitable for inserting the
Colombia Vs30 map into the global Vs30 map.  See the Makefile for
specifics of the processing.

This is almost a trivial insertion because the full extent of the new grid 
has calculated Vs30 values. Since we want to add them all into the global
mosaic, all we do is add a strip of zeros around the resampled map and then
use that to create the weighted clipping mask.

To create the necessary files to display the new Colombia Vs30 map, simply type

	% make

in this directory. To insert the new Colombia map into a global Vs30 map,
return to the top level directory and type

	% make

To check out the plots for almost every step, just type

	% make plots

To clean things up, type

	% make clean

Or just

	% make clean_plots

to only remove the plots.
