This directory downloads shape files from the J-SHIS web site and then
creates a grid file and a weighted clipping mask suitable
for inserting the Japanese Vs30 map into the global Vs30 map.
See the Makefile for specifics of the processing.

To create the necessary files and insert them into the global map, run
make in the Slope directory first, then in the other directories that 
you want included in the map, and then here you can simply issue the 
command:

	% make

Note that it is easier to achieve these results from the Makefile in
this directory's parent directory.
