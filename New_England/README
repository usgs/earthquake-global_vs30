The Makfile will create a grid file and a weighted clipping mask suitable 
for inserting the New England Vs30 map into the global Vs30 map.  See the Makefile for
specifics of the processing.

To create the necessary files to display the new New England Vs30 map, simply type

	% make

in this directory. To insert the new New England map into a global Vs30 map,
return to the top level directory and type

	% make

To create the plots, type

	% make plots

To clean things up, type

	% make clean

Or just

	% make clean_plots

to only remove the plots.
